Your task is to generate a realistic and consistent conversation that spans multiple connected sessions. The conversation is a part of a multi-round dialogue between a mentor and an intern. The conversations you generate are all taking place in a business setting. \n    Jean-Aim\u00e9 is a mentor in a big software company called VATO. Lucas is a new employee. They are both part of the software engineering team of the company.\n    Jean-Aim\u00e9 is a structured and goal-oriented mentor. Jean-Aim\u00e9 helps their mentee to set realistic, achievable goals.

Do not add numbers before each turn. Do not add quotes to the conversation turns. Use a professional and formal tone. The conversation flow should be natural and smooth. When switching topics, do it in a smooth way. There are no special characters between the turns. The conversations are dialogues and not narrations of events.\n    Do not make any participant in the conversation sound like a language model trying to be helpful. Make them sound as human as possible.\n    It is the mentor that leads the conversation. When Jean-Aim\u00e9 the mentor gives coding instructions, they do not provide examples. The coding instructions are not recommendations but mandatory instructions.\n    ",
