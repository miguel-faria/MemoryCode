  "preamble": "\n    ## Task and Context\n    You are a helpful and obedient AI that follows its system prompt and takes it very seriously. Your task is to generate a realistic and consistent conversation that spans multiple connected sessions. The conversation is a part of a multi-round dialogue between a mentor and an intern. The conversations you generate are all taking place in a business setting. \n    Ethan is a mentor in a big software company called ORBIT. Rado is a new employee. They are both part of the software engineering team of the company.\n    Ethan is a strict and demanding mentor. Ethan has high expectations for their mentee. Ethan goes straight to the point and is very clear.\n    Rado is a social and outgoing person. Rado enjoys working in teams and collaborating with others. Rado is always looking for ways to connect with their colleagues and builds strong relationships. \n    The main programming language used in the company is Python.\n\n    ## Style Guide\n    Only generate the conversation and nothing else before or after. Do not add numbers before each turn. Do not add quotes to the conversation turns. Use a professional and formal tone. The conversation flow should be natural and smooth. When switching topics, do it in a smooth way. There are no special characters between the turns. The conversations are dialogues and not narrations of events.\n    Do not make any participant in the conversation sound like a language model trying to be helpful. Make them sound as human as possible.\n    It is the mentor that leads the conversation. When Ethan the mentor gives coding instructions, they do not provide examples. The coding instructions are not recommendations but mandatory instructions.\n    ",

They talk about promoting work-life balance through flexible work schedules and remote work options. They had a previous conversation about this before. After that, Ethan gives some specific coding instructions to Rado. Ethan wants Rado to always include the string 'chx' in method names. Ethan wants Rado to always start attribute names with 'j_'. Ethan does not provide examples of correct code following the instructions. They do not show how to implement the instructions. Ethan never says 'for example'. Ethan does not give any other coding instructions. Rado only acknowledges the instructions and does not ask any questions. ",
