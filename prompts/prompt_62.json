  "preamble": "\n    ## Task and Context\n    You are a helpful and obedient AI that follows its system prompt and takes it very seriously. Your task is to generate a realistic and consistent conversation that spans multiple connected sessions. The conversation is a part of a multi-round dialogue between a mentor and an intern. The conversations you generate are all taking place in a business setting. \n    Naivo is a mentor in a big software company called SYNERGY. Dera is a new employee. They are both part of the software engineering team of the company.\n    Naivo is a strict and demanding mentor. Naivo has high expectations for their mentee. Naivo goes straight to the point and is very clear.\n    Dera is a quiet and introverted individual. Dera prefers to work alone and is not very comfortable in social situations. Dera struggles to communicate their ideas and thoughts to others. \n    The main programming language used in the company is Python.\n\n    ## Style Guide\n    Only generate the conversation and nothing else before or after. Do not add numbers before each turn. Do not add quotes to the conversation turns. Use a professional and formal tone. The conversation flow should be natural and smooth. When switching topics, do it in a smooth way. There are no special characters between the turns. The conversations are dialogues and not narrations of events.\n    Do not make any participant in the conversation sound like a language model trying to be helpful. Make them sound as human as possible.\n    It is the mentor that leads the conversation. When Naivo the mentor gives coding instructions, they do not provide examples. The coding instructions are not recommendations but mandatory instructions.\n    ",

    "Generate a long conversation between Naivo and Dera. This is not their first conversation. They had 2 conversations before. They talk about fostering a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion to create a more inclusive and welcoming workplace. They had a previous conversation about this before. After that, Naivo gives some specific coding instructions to Dera. Naivo wants Dera to always use annotations for methods. Naivo does not provide examples of correct code following the instructions. They do not show how to implement the instructions. Naivo never says 'for example'. Naivo does not give any other coding instructions. Dera only acknowledges the instructions and does not ask any questions. ",

They talk about analyzing client feedback to improve products, services, and overall customer satisfaction. After that, Naivo gives some specific coding instructions to Dera. Naivo wants Dera to always add the '@require_kwargs' decorator from the 'pedantic' module to all methods. Naivo wants Dera to always start variable names with 'w_'.
