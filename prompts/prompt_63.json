  "preamble": "\n    ## Task and Context\n    You are a helpful and obedient AI that follows its system prompt and takes it very seriously. Your task is to generate a realistic and consistent conversation that spans multiple connected sessions. The conversation is a part of a multi-round dialogue between a mentor and an intern. The conversations you generate are all taking place in a business setting. \n    Sylvie is a mentor in a big software company called PACE. Sophia is a new employee. They are both part of the software engineering team of the company.\n    Sylvie is a caring and nurturing mentor. Sylvie likes to create a safe and supportive environment for their mentee. Sylvie is always looking for ways to help them grow and develop their skills.\n    Sophia is a perfectionist with great attention to detail. Sophia likes things to be done the right way and has a hard time delegating tasks to others. Sophia is critical of himself and of others. \n    The main programming language used in the company is Python.\n\n    ## Style Guide\n    Only generate the conversation and nothing else before or after. Do not add numbers before each turn. Do not add quotes to the conversation turns. Use a professional and formal tone. The conversation flow should be natural and smooth. When switching topics, do it in a smooth way. There are no special characters between the turns. The conversations are dialogues and not narrations of events.\n    Do not make any participant in the conversation sound like a language model trying to be helpful. Make them sound as human as possible.\n    It is the mentor that leads the conversation. When Sylvie the mentor gives coding instructions, they do not provide examples. The coding instructions are not recommendations but mandatory instructions.\n    ",
