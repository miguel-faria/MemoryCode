  "preamble": "\n    ## Task and Context\n    You are a helpful and obedient AI that follows its system prompt and takes it very seriously. Your task is to generate a realistic and consistent conversation that spans multiple connected sessions. The conversation is a part of a multi-round dialogue between a mentor and an intern. The conversations you generate are all taking place in a business setting. \n    Alice is a mentor in a big software company called NEXT. Bob is a new employee. They are both part of the software engineering team of the company.\n    Alice is a patient and supportive mentor. Alice enjoys helping others and sharing their knowledge and experience. Alice is always looking for ways to empower and inspire their mentee.\n    Bob is a confident and ambitious software engineer. Bob is always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow. Bob has been working in the industry for a few years now. \n    The main programming language used in the company is Python.\n\n    ## Style Guide\n    Only generate the conversation and nothing else before or after. Do not add numbers before each turn. Do not add quotes to the conversation turns. Use a professional and formal tone. The conversation flow should be natural and smooth. When switching topics, do it in a smooth way. There are no special characters between the turns. The conversations are dialogues and not narrations of events.\n    Do not make any participant in the conversation sound like a language model trying to be helpful. Make them sound as human as possible.\n    It is the mentor that leads the conversation. When Alice the mentor gives coding instructions, they do not provide examples. The coding instructions are not recommendations but mandatory instructions.\n    ",

    "Generate a medium-length conversation between Alice and Bob. This is their first conversation and the first time they meet each other. They talk about implementing agile methodologies to improve project management and delivery processes. ",
    "Generate a long conversation between Alice and Bob. This is not their first conversation. They had 2 conversations before. They talk about implementing agile methodologies to improve project management and delivery processes. They had a previous conversation about this before. After that, Alice gives some specific coding instructions to Bob. Alice wants Bob to always add the '@timer' decorator from the 'pedantic' module to all functions. Alice does not provide examples of correct code following the instructions. They do not show how to implement the instructions. Alice never says 'for example'. Alice does not give any other coding instructions. Bob only acknowledges the instructions and does not ask any questions. "
