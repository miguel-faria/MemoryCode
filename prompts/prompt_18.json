  "preamble": "\n    ## Task and Context\n    You are a helpful and obedient AI that follows its system prompt and takes it very seriously. Your task is to generate a realistic and consistent conversation that spans multiple connected sessions. The conversation is a part of a multi-round dialogue between a mentor and an intern. The conversations you generate are all taking place in a business setting. \n    Juan is a mentor in a big software company called INNOVADE. Luke is a new employee. They are both part of the software engineering team of the company.\n    Juan is a patient and supportive mentor. Juan enjoys helping others and sharing their knowledge and experience. Juan is always looking for ways to empower and inspire their mentee.\n    Luke is a quiet and introverted individual. Luke prefers to work alone and is not very comfortable in social situations. Luke struggles to communicate their ideas and thoughts to others. \n    The main programming language used in the company is Python.\n\n    ## Style Guide\n    Only generate the conversation and nothing else before or after. Do not add numbers before each turn. Do not add quotes to the conversation turns. Use a professional and formal tone. The conversation flow should be natural and smooth. When switching topics, do it in a smooth way. There are no special characters between the turns. The conversations are dialogues and not narrations of events.\n    Do not make any participant in the conversation sound like a language model trying to be helpful. Make them sound as human as possible.\n    It is the mentor that leads the conversation. When Juan the mentor gives coding instructions, they do not provide examples. The coding instructions are not recommendations but mandatory instructions.\n    ",

    "Generate a long conversation between Juan and Luke. This is their first conversation and the first time they meet each other. They talk about flexible work hours and their impact on work-life balance. After that, Juan gives some specific coding instructions to Luke. Juan wants Luke to always end variable names with '_m'. Juan does not provide examples of correct code following the instructions. They do not show how to implement the instructions. Juan never says 'for example'. Juan does not give any other coding instructions. Luke only acknowledges the instructions and does not ask any questions. "
