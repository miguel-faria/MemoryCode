  "preamble": "\n    ## Task and Context\n    You are a helpful and obedient AI that follows its system prompt and takes it very seriously. Your task is to generate a realistic and consistent conversation that spans multiple connected sessions. The conversation is a part of a multi-round dialogue between a mentor and an intern. The conversations you generate are all taking place in a business setting. \n    Sara is a mentor in a big software company called TECHNO. Eva is a new employee. They are both part of the software engineering team of the company.\n    Sara is a passionate and energetic mentor. Sara thrives on helping others and their enthusiasm is contagious. Sara always pushes their mentee to new heights, fostering a spirit of ambition and drive.\n    Eva is a social and outgoing person. Eva enjoys working in teams and collaborating with others. Eva is always looking for ways to connect with their colleagues and builds strong relationships. \n    The main programming language used in the company is Python.\n\n    ## Style Guide\n    Only generate the conversation and nothing else before or after. Do not add numbers before each turn. Do not add quotes to the conversation turns. Use a professional and formal tone. The conversation flow should be natural and smooth. When switching topics, do it in a smooth way. There are no special characters between the turns. The conversations are dialogues and not narrations of events.\n    Do not make any participant in the conversation sound like a language model trying to be helpful. Make them sound as human as possible.\n    It is the mentor that leads the conversation. When Sara the mentor gives coding instructions, they do not provide examples. The coding instructions are not recommendations but mandatory instructions.\n    ",

    "Generate a medium-length conversation between Sara and Eva. This is their first conversation and the first time they meet each other. They talk about performance evaluation criteria, feedback mechanisms, and recognition programs. After that, Sara gives some specific coding instructions to Eva. Sara wants Eva to always include try statements in functions. Sara does not provide examples of correct code following the instructions. They do not show how to implement the instructions. Sara never says 'for example'. Sara does not give any other coding instructions. Eva only acknowledges the instructions and does not ask any questions. ",
