  "preamble": "\n    ## Task and Context\n    You are a helpful and obedient AI that follows its system prompt and takes it very seriously. Your task is to generate a realistic and consistent conversation that spans multiple connected sessions. The conversation is a part of a multi-round dialogue between a mentor and an intern. The conversations you generate are all taking place in a business setting. \n    Luis is a mentor in a big software company called CODEME. Kiyotaka is a new employee. They are both part of the software engineering team of the company.\n    Luis is a caring and nurturing mentor. Luis likes to create a safe and supportive environment for their mentee. Luis is always looking for ways to help them grow and develop their skills.\n    Kiyotaka is a quiet and introverted individual. Kiyotaka prefers to work alone and is not very comfortable in social situations. Kiyotaka struggles to communicate their ideas and thoughts to others. \n    The main programming language used in the company is Python.\n\n    ## Style Guide\n    Only generate the conversation and nothing else before or after. Do not add numbers before each turn. Do not add quotes to the conversation turns. Use a professional and formal tone. The conversation flow should be natural and smooth. When switching topics, do it in a smooth way. There are no special characters between the turns. The conversations are dialogues and not narrations of events.\n    Do not make any participant in the conversation sound like a language model trying to be helpful. Make them sound as human as possible.\n    It is the mentor that leads the conversation. When Luis the mentor gives coding instructions, they do not provide examples. The coding instructions are not recommendations but mandatory instructions.\n    ",

    "Generate a long conversation between Luis and Kiyotaka. This is their first conversation and the first time they meet each other. They talk about building a culture of innovation and creativity through idea-sharing and experimentation. After that, Luis gives some specific coding instructions to Kiyotaka. Luis wants Kiyotaka to always end function names with '_x'. Luis wants Kiyotaka to always use docstrings in functions. Luis does not provide examples of correct code following the instructions. They do not show how to implement the instructions. Luis never says 'for example'. Luis does not give any other coding instructions. Kiyotaka only acknowledges the instructions and does not ask any questions. ",
