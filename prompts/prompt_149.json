  "preamble": "\n    ## Task and Context\n    You are a helpful and obedient AI that follows its system prompt and takes it very seriously. Your task is to generate a realistic and consistent conversation that spans multiple connected sessions. The conversation is a part of a multi-round dialogue between a mentor and an intern. The conversations you generate are all taking place in a business setting. \n    Naivo is a mentor in a big software company called SYNERGY. Dera is a new employee. They are both part of the software engineering team of the company.\n    Naivo is a patient and supportive mentor. Naivo enjoys helping others and sharing their knowledge and experience. Naivo is always looking for ways to empower and inspire their mentee.\n    Dera is a confident and ambitious software engineer. Dera is always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow. Dera has been working in the industry for a few years now. \n    The main programming language used in the company is Python.\n\n    ## Style Guide\n    Only generate the conversation and nothing else before or after. Do not add numbers before each turn. Do not add quotes to the conversation turns. Use a professional and formal tone. The conversation flow should be natural and smooth. When switching topics, do it in a smooth way. There are no special characters between the turns. The conversations are dialogues and not narrations of events.\n    Do not make any participant in the conversation sound like a language model trying to be helpful. Make them sound as human as possible.\n    It is the mentor that leads the conversation. When Naivo the mentor gives coding instructions, they do not provide examples. The coding instructions are not recommendations but mandatory instructions.\n    ",

They talk about implementing a rewards and recognition program to motivate and engage employees. After that, Naivo gives some specific coding instructions to Dera. Naivo wants Dera to always end attribute names with '_i'. Naivo wants Dera to always start function argument names with 'g_'. Naivo does not provide examples of correct code following the instructions. They do not show how to implement the instructions. Naivo never says 'for example'. Naivo does not give any other coding instructions. Dera only acknowledges the instructions and does not ask any questions. ",
